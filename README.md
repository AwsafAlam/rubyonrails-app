## Rails generator

The rails generator does a lot of boilerplate work so developers don't have to configure everything individually.

- `rails generate controller home index`

Output:

```
Running via Spring preloader in process 73401
      create  app/controllers/home_controller.rb
       route  get 'home/index'
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/home
      create    app/views/home/index.html.erb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/controllers/home_controller_test.rb
      invoke  helper
      create    app/helpers/home_helper.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      invoke  assets
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/home.scss
```
